## Particle Swarm Optimization

PSO is a kind of evolutionary algorithm inspired by social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling.

The basic operation of PSO is given by

1. Initialize the swarm from the solution space
2. Evaluate fitness of individual particles
3. Update _gbest_, _pbest_ and velocity

and repeat step 2 and 3 until convergence or stopping condition is satisfied.
